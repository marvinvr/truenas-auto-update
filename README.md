# TrueNAS Auto Update

Yes, I know what you're thinking - "You shouldn't auto-update your TrueNAS apps!" And you're probably right. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to live on the edge, this Docker container will automatically update your TrueNAS SCALE apps whenever updates are available.

## Environment Variables

- `BASE_URL`: Your TrueNAS SCALE instance URL (e.g., `https://truenas.local`)
- `API_KEY`: Your TrueNAS API key (can be generated in the UI under System Settings → API Keys)
- `CRON_SCHEDULE` (_optional_): Cron schedule for when to check for updates (e.g., `0 4 * * *` for daily at 4 AM). If not set, the script will run once and then exit.
- `APPRISE_URLS` (_optional_): Apprise URLs to send notifications to (e.g., `https://example.com/apprise,https://example.com/apprise2`) More info on [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)
- `NOTIFY_ON_SUCCESS` (_optional_): Set to "true" to receive notifications when apps are successfully updated (default: "false")
- `ONLY_UPDATE_STARTED_APPS` (_optional_): Set to "true" to only update apps that are currently running/powered-on (default: "false"). This helps avoid unnecessary updates for apps that are stopped.
- `EXCLUDE_APPS` (_optional_): Comma-separated list of app names to skip during updates (e.g., `app1,app2`). This is useful if you want to exclude certain apps from being updated automatically.
- `INCLUDE_APPS` (_optional_): Comma-separated list of app names to include during updates (e.g., `app1,app2`). This is useful if you want to only update certain apps and skip the rest.

NOTE: The `EXCLUDE_APPS` and `INCLUDE_APPS` variables are mutually exclusive. If both are set, the application will error out.

## Getting Started

1. Generate an API key in your TrueNAS SCALE UI:

   - Go to System Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Add"
   - Give it a name and save
   - Copy the API key to your clipboard
   
2. Deploy the container:
- Run the container on any Docker host:

```bash
docker run --name truenas-auto-update \
         --restart unless-stopped \
         -e BASE_URL=https://your-truenas-url \
         -e API_KEY=your-api-key \
         -e CRON_SCHEDULE="0 4 * * *" \
         -e APPRISE_URLS="https://example.com/apprise,https://example.com/apprise2" \
         -e NOTIFY_ON_SUCCESS="true" \
         -e ONLY_UPDATE_STARTED_APPS="true" \
         ghcr.io/marvinvr/truenas-auto-update
```

- **or** install it as a Custom App in SCALE:

1. Go to the Apps page in SCALE
2. Click "Discover Apps" in the top right
3. Click "Custom App" in the top right
4. Set the following values:
   - Name: `TrueNAS Auto Update`
   - Repository: `ghcr.io/marvinvr/truenas-auto-update`
   - Tag: `latest`
   - Environment Variables (As described above)
   - Restart Policy: `Unless Stopped`
5. Install the app
6. (_optional_) Review the app logs to ensure it's working as expected

## Disclaimer

This tool automatically updates your TrueNAS SCALE apps without manual intervention. While convenient, this could potentially lead to issues if an update introduces problems. Use at your own risk and make sure you have proper backups!
